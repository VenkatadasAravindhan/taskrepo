PID-Process ID
NI-Nice value..Lower the value the process will not be stopped even during the lower resource available situation.
VIRT-Virtual Memory
SHR-Shared resource
Uninterrupted sleep: The process is waiting for the CPU memory.
Eg: mkdir dir1 (once the CPU memory is available the dir will be created)
Interrupted sleep: The process is waiting for the other process.
Eg: ls | head -5 (the -5 will wait until the ls head is implemented)

Process states:
Parent Process
Child Process - Process that is invoked by the Parent Process
